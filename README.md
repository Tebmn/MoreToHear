# More To Hear

![alt text](tebmn.moretohear.thumbnail.jpg)

Should provide a non-intrusive, lore-friendly experience. Does not alter or add any ship logs

This mod re implements content added by both [Signals+](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/signals/) and [Backers satellite signal](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/backerssatellitesignal/) among other things, and will likely create a confusing experience if used together. 

~~Made in spite of xen-42 and the vastly inferior mod [Signals+](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/signals/) which you definitely shouldn't check out as well.~~

Open to suggestions or requests.
